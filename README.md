# Exploring-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores
This project analyzes SAT performance across New York City public schools, providing insights critical for policymakers, education professionals, researchers, government agencies, and parents evaluating educational quality. The SAT is a standardized test measuring literacy, numeracy, and writing skills through three sections—reading, math, and writing—each scored up to 800 points, playing a pivotal role in college admissions decisions. Using the schools.csv dataset containing information on 375 NYC public schools, the analysis explores SAT score distributions, identifies top-performing and underperforming schools, and examines performance variations across NYC boroughs including Manhattan and other areas. This data-driven exploration provides actionable intelligence for stakeholders seeking to understand educational performance patterns, identify schools of excellence, and inform evidence-based decisions regarding school selection and educational policy improvements within the NYC school system.
